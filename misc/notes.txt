Port routing:
 - Determine internal IP:
     ifconfig | grep 192  ==>  inet 192.168.1.113
 - Forward port in router:
     Add single port forward (in=8080, out=8080, ip=113)
 - Get public IP:
     https://www.google.com/search?q=ip  ==>  98.248.42.191
 - Set IPN url to IP:
     http://98.248.42.191:8080
