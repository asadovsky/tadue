<p>Our products and services ("Services") are provided by Tadue.</p>

<p>By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully.</p>

<div class="header">Using our Services</div>

<p>You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.</p>

<p>Don't misuse our Services. For example, don't interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.</p>

<p>Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don't remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.</p>

<p>Our Services display some content that is not Tadue's. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don't assume that we do.</p>

<p>In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You may opt out of some of those communications.</p>

<div class="header">Your Tadue Account</div>

<p>You may need a Tadue Account in order to use some of our Services. You may create your own Tadue Account.</p>

<div class="header">Privacy and Copyright Protection</div>

<p>Tadue's <a href="/privacy">privacy policies</a> explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our Services. By using our Services, you agree that Tadue can use such data in accordance with our privacy policies.</p>

<div class="header">Your Content in our Services</div>

<p>Some of our Services allow you to submit content.</p>

<p>When you upload or otherwise submit content to our Services, you give Tadue (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.</p>

<div class="header">Modifying and Terminating our Services</div>

<p>We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.</p>

<p>You can stop using our Services at any time. Tadue may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.</p>

<div class="header">Our Warranties and Disclaimers</div>

<p>We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we don't promise about our Services.</p>

<p>OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER TADUE NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON'T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTION OF THE SERVICES, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES "AS IS".</p>

<p>SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES.</p>

<div class="header">Liability for our Services</div>

<p>WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, TADUE, AND TADUE'S SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.</p>

<p>TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF TADUE, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIM UNDER THESE TERMS, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE SERVICES (OR, IF WE CHOOSE, TO SUPPLYING YOU THE SERVICES AGAIN).</p>

<p>IN ALL CASES, TADUE, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.</p>

<div class="header">Business uses of our Services</div>

<p>If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify Tadue and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys' fees.</p>

<div class="header">About these Terms</div>

<p>We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We'll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.</p>

<p>If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.</p>

<p>These terms control the relationship between Tadue and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.</p>

<p>If you do not comply with these terms, and we don't take action right away, this doesn't mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).</p>

<p>If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.</p>

<p>The laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California's conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Tadue consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.</p>
