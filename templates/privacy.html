<div>
  <p>At Tadue, we have a few fundamental privacy principles:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>We don't ask for your personal information unless we need it.</li>
    <li>We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop and operate our services, or protect our rights.</li>
    <li>We don't store your personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of our services.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Our Privacy Policy incorporates these goals, and covers all websites operated by Tadue, including <a href="http://tadue.com/">tadue.com</a>. It is based on the one developed by <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> and is available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons ShareAlike</a> license.</p>

<div class="header">Website Visitors</div>

<p>Like most website operators, Tadue collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Tadue's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Tadue's visitors use its websites. From time to time, Tadue may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g. by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its websites.</p>

<p>Tadue also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged-in users. Tadue only discloses logged-in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

<div class="header">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</div>

<p>Certain visitors to Tadue's websites choose to interact with Tadue in ways that require Tadue to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Tadue gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who create an account to provide an email address. In each case, Tadue collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Tadue. Tadue does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

<div class="header">Aggregated Statistics</div>

<p>Tadue may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Tadue may monitor the number and size of payments requested on its websites. Tadue may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Tadue does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<div class="header">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</div>

<p>Tadue discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Tadue's behalf or to provide services available at Tadue's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Tadue's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Tadue will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Tadue discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Tadue believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Tadue, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Tadue website and have supplied your email address, Tadue may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Tadue. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Tadue takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<div class="header">Cookies</div>

<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Tadue uses cookies to help Tadue identify and track visitors, their usage of Tadue's websites, and their website access preferences. Tadue visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should configure their browsers to refuse cookies before using Tadue's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Tadue's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<div class="header">Business Transfers</div>

<p>If Tadue, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Tadue goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Tadue may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

<div class="header">Ads</div>

<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Tadue and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<div class="header">Privacy Policy Changes</div>

<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Tadue may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Tadue's sole discretion. Tadue encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
